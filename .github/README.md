> This repo was once only for my nvim dotfiles, but over time I kept adding more and more and now it houses my whole setup.

# Want to try it?

I use [Yadm](https://yadm.io/) to manage my dotfiles, if you want my config you can run:

> ⚠️ This will overwrite your current configurations. If you are unsure, just clone the repo normally (with git) and pick what you want :). Or try it in a VM.

> 🙃 The init script will only work on Arch (or Arch-based distros). Sorry. (I'm working on a osx version tho)

```
$ yadm clone https://github.com/iteration-A/shinobu
$ ~/.local/scripts/init.sh
```
